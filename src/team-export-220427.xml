		<Bio><![CDATA[<p>Driven by his innate intellectual curiosity and broad social and cultural perspective, Frederick Fisher, AIA FAAR approaches architecture as a collaborative process. Fred gained stature in the art and academic worlds by designing exceptional spaces for the practice and exhibition of art, as well as for interdisciplinary study. Recognition of his legacy of design excellence is reflected in his receipt of the 2013 Gold Medal by the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. He is a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome, where he combined his passions for art and architecture in the exploration of museum meaning and design. A registered architect since 1978, Fred received his Bachelor of Arts degree in Art and Art History from Oberlin College and his Master of Architecture from UCLA. He was Chairman of the Environmental Design Department at Otis College of Art &#038; Design, and currently serves as a Trustee. He is also a Board Member for the Board of Councilors at USC School of Architecture, the Board of Visitors at the UCLA School of the Arts, the Ojai Music Festival, and Lawrence University. As Founding Partner, Fred directs a practice that prides itself on architecture that is responsive, realistic, responsible, and revelatory. “If you make something that brings people pleasure and fulfillment,” he says, “then you’ve done your job as an architect.”</p>

		<Bio><![CDATA[<p>Marisa Kurtzman, RA, LEED AP brings energy and focus to spearheading FF&#038;P’s visioning, programming, and planning work. A linguist and a “people person,” she loves finding out what makes institutions and organizations tick, and then translating those values and goals into design concepts that are distinctly expressive of their identities.

		<Bio><![CDATA[<p>A native of Japan and a graduate of SCI-Arc, Takashige Ikawa is both precise and poetic. Perhaps due to his early training as a photographer, he sees architecture as a series of emotional moments to be connected through space and time. Whether designing a house, an exhibition, or a large creative workspace, Taka immerses himself in context and the spirit of a place. The results are diverse, but consistently thoughtful and thought-through.</p>
