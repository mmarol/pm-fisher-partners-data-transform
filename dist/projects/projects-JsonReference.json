We designed three galleries for him over twenty years, each an understated, well-structured envelope for the contemporary and historic art he exhibits. Each balanced natural and artificial light and integrated easily into its urban environment.  The new Marc Selwyn Gallery opened in 2014 in Beverly Hills, the neighborhood where many of the gallery’s clients live and work. Clients stop by on lunch breaks or on their way home, making the space part of a community’s daily rituals. Our design, simple and minimal in its ethos, makes room for these daily interactions while keeping art in the spotlight.  Formerly home to Al Grimmett & Sons Garage and built in the 1940s, the original building featured brick walls and wooden trusses. We embraced this resilient and elegant industrial fabric, transforming the structure into a 3,000-square-foot home for exhibitions, art storage, private offices and meetings. The red brick façade remains and existing recesses became windows and doors, wide glass squares along the sidewalk that give passersby a glimpse of the art.  Inside, the rooms achieve an organic rhythm, inviting visitors to meander from one volume into the next. The corridor between the street and the main galleries serves as a feature wall for exhibiting small groups of artworks and leads into one small and one large exhibition space. In these galleries, the white-painted trusses create a high-ceilinged, wide-open effect, but the walls themselves are lower and uninterrupted, keeping the expanses of space and surface adaptable to a wide variety of artworks.  Both sky-lit with adjustable track lighting suspended above, the rooms adapt gracefully to either monumental or intimate projects. For the inaugural show of work by landscape photographer Richard Misrach, the galleries held large, formally compelling abstractions of foliage, and the long walls served as wide, neutral frames. A year later, Lee Mullican’s obsessive, spiritual paintings hung alongside Marjorie Cameron’s much smaller, vulnerable drawings.

The mostly transparent façade reflects the adjacent sycamore trees, which also inspired the us to integrate three colors of prefabricated, opaque glass panels into the surface.  Their patterning of slim vertical columns interspersed with thicker horizontal rectangles responds to the sun’s path, thus regulating glare, heat gain, and natural light.

Perpendicular to these two boundaries is a second line of six more cypress trees to form the northeast corner. On the south side of the museum, beyond view, a line of four additional cypresses planted parallel to the building, serves as the “entry hall” for the “room” to the west.  This outdoor living room defines and delineates a contemplative space as well as providing a means to assimilate the disparate elements of the landscape and to view them as a total composition. This raises aesthetic and philosophical issues concerning what has become known as public or site-specific art.  Encountering the lines of trees that slowly reveal themselves as design elements, the viewer is surprised into seeing the entire garden as sculpture. While respecting the integrity of the materials, they are manipulated to achieve relationships that communicate visual intent while retaining the unique and inherent qualities of each. The cypress and plum trees of “room” are deliberately placed so that each tree reveals its intrinsic beauty while still contributing to the whole.
